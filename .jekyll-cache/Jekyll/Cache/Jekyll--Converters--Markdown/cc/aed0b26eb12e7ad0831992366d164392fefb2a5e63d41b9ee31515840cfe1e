<p>I am a first year Ph.D. student at Carleton University, within <a href="https://cglab.ca/">the Computational Geometry Lab</a>, I am advised by <a href="https://cglab.ca/~morin/">Prof. Pat Morin</a> and <a href="https://cglab.ca/~vida/">Prof. Vida Dujmoviƒá</a>.</p>

<p>I graduated with a master degree in Computer Science from the <a href="https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php">Parisian Master of Research in Computer Science</a>, I was a student at <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">Ecole Polytechnique</a> and <a href="https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/">Paris-Saclay University</a>.</p>

<p>I was very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~vcohen/">Prof. Vincent Cohen-Addad</a> during  my master research internship at <a href="https://www.lip6.fr/recherche/team.php?acronyme=RO">LIP6</a>.</p>

<p>During my undergraduate studies, I was a USAID Scholar at the <a href="http://www.aub.edu.lb/">American University of Beirut</a> where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Computational Science in 2017.</p>

<p>My research interests include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>lgorithms and Complexity Theory</li>
  <li>Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry</li>
  <li>Computational Science</li>
</ul>

I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it.
