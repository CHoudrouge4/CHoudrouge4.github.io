I am currently a research intern at LORIA/INRIA Grand Est in Nancy. The topic of my internship is Topological Optimisation.

### Research Interests
I am interested in different areas of research in mathematics and computer science. 
* Algorithms 
* Discrete and Computational Geometry
* Computational Physics
* Computer Graphics 
* Complexity Theory
* Cryptography 
* Scientific Computing
* Topological Optimisation

### Education
* Ecole Polytechnique de Paris (l'X)
	* Master in Algorithms and Foundations of Programming Languages
* American University of Beirut (AUB)
	* BSc in Computer Science 
	* Minor in Computational Science

### Projects
* Computing Geodesic Distance Based on Heat Flow 
	Implemented a technique based on heat flow to compute the geodesic distance over meshes. The implementation is based on [this paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/HeatMethod/index.html).

* Imgs
	Implemented an Android mobile image search application based on machine learning and deep learning techniques for the final year project.

### Awards 
* United States Agency for International Development - USAID
	Awarded full scholarship to study BSc. in Computer Science at the American University of Beirut.

* ACM - LCPC The Lebanese Collegiate Programming Contest
	Won the first place (team 1729).
