Hi! I am a grad computer science student at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) and research intern at [Lip6](https://www.lip6.fr/recherche/team.php?acronyme=RO). My current research topic is Geometric Approximation Algorithm.Â I have a strong interest in Discrete & Computational Geometry, Combinatorial Optimization, Graph Theory, and Fixed-Parameter Complexity. My CV can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/cv.pdf).
