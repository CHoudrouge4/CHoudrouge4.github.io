Hi! I graduated recently with a master degree in computer science from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/). I did my master research internship at [LIP6](https://www.lip6.fr/recherche/team.php?acronyme=RO).

Previously, I was  a USAID Scholar at the [American University of Beirut](http://www.aub.edu.lb/) where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Computational Science in 2017.

My research interests include Discrete & Computational Geometry, Combinatorial Optimization, Graph Theory, and Fixed-Parameter Complexity. My CV can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/cv.pdf).

## Publications
  * **Subquadratic High-Dimensional Hierarchical Clustering**
  Joint work with [Vincent Cohen-Addad](https://www.di.ens.fr/~vcohen/) and Amir Abboud.
To appear in the proceedings of the conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2019.
