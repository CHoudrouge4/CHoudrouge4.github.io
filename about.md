I am a third year Ph.D. student at Carleton University, within [The Algorithms, Graphs, and Geometry Lab](https://cglab.ca/), I am supervised by [Prof. Pat Morin](https://cglab.ca/~morin/) and [Prof. Vida Dujmović](https://cglab.ca/~vida/).

I graduated with a master degree in Computer Science from the [Parisian Master of Research in Computer Science](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php), I was a student at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) and [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/).

 I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Vincent Cohen-Addad](https://www.di.ens.fr/~vcohen/) during  my master research internship at [LIP6](https://www.lip6.fr/recherche/team.php?acronyme=RO).

During my undergraduate studies, I was a USAID Scholar at the [American University of Beirut](http://www.aub.edu.lb/) where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Computational Science in 2017.

My research interests include:
* The intersections between Theoretical Computer Science, Geometry, and Topology. 
* Computational Science (Computational physics, numerical simulation...).

My CV can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/cv.pdf).

##### *"Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn’t matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough." - Richard P. Feynman*

##### *“Above all, do not lose your desire to walk. Everyday, I walk myself into a state of well-being & walk away from every illness. I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it. But by sitting still, & the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill. Thus if one just keeps on walking, everything will be all right.” ― Søren Kierkegaard*
