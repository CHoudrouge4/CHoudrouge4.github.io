# COMP 5202/4202

## Assignment 2 answers

* Question 1
Check this [link](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/160746/equality-of-voronoi-diagram
).

Voronoi Diagram has a unique point set if and only if the points are in general positions i.e.
No three points are collinear, and no four points are co-circular. Such point set has a unique Delaunay triangulation which implies a unique Vornoi Diagram.

* Question 2
Check the following [document.]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/COMP_5204.pdf).

* Question 3 may have several answers as far as it make sense, it is correct.
* Question 4 is straightforward from the Lecture.
